The iPhone is Apple's line of smartphones, which run the iOS operating system. The first iPhone was unveiled by Steve Jobs on January 9, 2007. Since then, new models have been released annually. When it was introduced, its multi-touch screen was described as "revolutionary" and a "game-changer" for the mobile phone industry. The device has been credited with creating the app economy.

	<p align="justify">
As of 2022, the iPhone has 15% market share, yet represents 50% of global smartphone revenues, with Android phones accounting for the rest.[180][181] The iPhone has generated large profits for the company, and is credited with helping to make Apple one of the world's most valuable publicly traded companies.

The iPad is Apple's line of tablets which run iPadOS. The first-generation iPad was announced on January 27, 2010. The iPad is mainly marketed for consuming multimedia, creating art, working on documents, videoconferencing, and playing games. The iPad lineup consists of several base iPad models, and the smaller iPad Mini, upgraded iPad Air, and high-end iPad Pro. Apple has consistently improved the iPad's performance, with the iPad Pro adopting the same M1 and M2 chips as the Mac; but the iPad still receives criticism for its limited OS
	</p>
<p align="center">
As of September 2020, Apple has sold more than 500 million iPads, though sales peaked in 2013.[185] The iPad still remains the most popular tablet computer by sales as of the second quarter of 2020,[186] and accounted for nine percent of the company's revenue as of the end of 2021.[1]
Apple sells several iPad accessories, including the Apple Pencil, Smart Keyboard, Smart Keyboard Folio, Magic Keyboard, and several adapters.

 Apple's primary desktop computer. The iMac is an "all-in-one," which houses the computer, drives and monitor in the same case. Apple also makes two computers with separate monitors: a mini desktop and workstation (see Mac mini and Mac Pro).
 The top iMac model used to be the iMac Pro. The Pro name was subsequently dropped, but the current 27" iMac is similar (see iMac Pro). In 2021, the first iMac with Apple's M1 processor debuted, and both Apple and Intel models are available as follows (see Apple M series).
